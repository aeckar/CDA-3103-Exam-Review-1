Read-Only Memory (ROM),Stores permanent data that persists after shutdown
Random-Access Memory (RAM),Stores temporary data is cleared after shutdown
Static RAM (SRAM),Faster, but smaller type of RAM
Dynamic RAM (DRAM),Slower, but larger type of RAM
refresh,Application of electricity to prevent capacitors in DRAM from leaking
Disk memory,Stores large amounts of data that persists after shutdown
Cache memory,Memory type that loads data from main memory
Main memory,Memory type that loads data from disk
register,Smallest, but fastest unit of memory
hit,Requested data resides on same level of memory
miss,Requested data does not reside on same level of memory
hit rate,Percent of requested data found in a given level of memory
miss rate,Percent of requested data not found on given level of memory
hit time,Time required to access requested data
miss penalty,Time spent processing a miss
temporal locality,Keep recently accessed data closer to CPU
spatial locality,Move contiguous blocks of data at a time
direct-mapped cache (DMC),Every block in main memory is assigned a specific block in cache
set-associative (SA) cache,Every block in main memory is assigned a specific set in cache
fully-associative (FA) cache,Blocks in main memory are stored in the next available block in cache
virtual memory,A digital representation of memory much larger than physical memory.
What is the benefit of virtual memory?,It makes it easier for programmers and users to address memory.
page,Fixed-size sections of virtual memory that map to page frames in physical memory
page frame,Fixed-size sections of physical memory that are the counterpart to pages in virtual memory
effective access time (EAT),the average time to access a block of memory
internal fragmentation,fragmentation that occurs when a block allocates more memory than is needed to be held
external fragmentation,fragmentation that occurs when small amounts of memory are deallocated over a wide area
The tag field of a main memory address is used to determine:

a. if the cache entry is valid
b. if the cache entry is the desired block
c. if the memory address is valid
d. none of the above,b
"Locality of reference" refers to:

a. clustering of memory references
b. programs always referencing data in RAM
c. data always being in cache
d. the requirement that forces us to use a large amount of expensive memory,a
Which of the following types of memory needs to be refreshed periodically to maintain its data?

a. DRAM
b. SRAM
c. ROM
d. all of the above,a

b. secondary memory
c. main memory
d. registers,b
Which of the following types of memory has the shortest (fastest) access time?

a. main memory
b. cache memory
c. registers
d. secondary memory,c
The main memory in a desktop personal computer is made of:

a. cache
b. ROM
c. RAM
d. none of the above,c
The average time required to reach a memory storage location and retrieve its contents is called:

a. hit time
b. effective access time
c. response time
d. latency,b
A major advantage of direct mapped cache is its simplicity and ease of implementation. The main disadvantage of direct mapped cache is:

a. its performance is degraded if two or more blocks that map to the same location are used alternately
b. it has a greater access time than any other method
c. it is more expensive than fully associative and set associative mapping
d. it does not allow the cache to store the tag that corresponds to the block currently residing in that cache location,a
What characteristic of RAM makes it unsuitable for permanent storage?

a. too slow
b. volatile
c. not reliable
d. all of the above,b
The approach of using a combination of memory types to provide the best performance at the best cost is called:

a. solid state memory
b. caching
c. offline memory
d. hierarchical memory,d
