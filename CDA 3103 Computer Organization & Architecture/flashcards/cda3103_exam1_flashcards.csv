Computer Architecture,concerns itself with instruction sets and formats, operation codes, data types, the number and types of registers, addressing modes, main memory access methods, and various I/O mechanisms.
Computer Organization,encompasses all physical aspects of computer systems (circuit design, control signals, memory types.).
Moore's Law,"The density of transistors in an integrated circuit will double every year."
Rock's Law,"The cost of capital equipment to build semiconductors will double every four years."
At the most basic level, a computer is a device consisting of three pieces:,processor, memory, I/O mechanism
Processor,interprets and executes programs
Memory,stores both data and programs
Level 6: The User Level,- Program execution and user interface level.
- The level with which we are most familiar.
- Executable programs.
Level 5: High-Level Language Level,- The level with which we interact when we write programs in languages such as C, Pascal, Lisp, and Java.
Level 4: Assembly Language Level,- Acts upon assembly language produced from Level 5, as well as instructions programmed directly at this level.
Level 3: System Software Level,- Controls executing processes on the system.
- Protects system resources.
- Assembly language instructions often pass through Level 3 without modification.
Level 2: Machine Level,- Also known as the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Level.
- Consists of instructions that are particular to the architecture of the machine.
- Programs written in machine language need no compilers, interpreters, or assemblers.
Level 1: Control Level,- A control unit decodes and executes instructions and moves data through the system.
- Control units can be microprogrammed or hardwired.
Level 0: Digital Logic Level,- This level is where we find digital circuits (the chips).
- Digital circuits consist of gates and wires.
- These components implement the mathematical logic of all other levels.
The level of the computer hierarchy that is composed of gates and wires is the,Digital Logic Level
The level of the computer hierarchy where an operating system functions is the,System Software Level
The Von Neumann Model consists of,- a memory, containing instructions and data
- a processing unit, for performing arithmetic and logical operations
- a control unit, for interpreting instructions
Von Neumann Bottleneck,describes the single processor-memory path
A three way hardware system consists of,a central processing unit (CPU) with a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers (small storage areas), a main memory system, and an I/O system
